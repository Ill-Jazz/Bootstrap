# Bootstrap

## TO DO

* Complete the exercises underneath  
* Use Bootstrap only  
* Add comments to code



# Title: Grid away, grid ahoy!

## The Mission
- Recreate the layout below (use whatever text and images you want), just respect the layout
- Try to get as close as possible without writing CSS
- Add a navigation sidebar to the left, with some dummy links in them
- Style the navigation bar using only the framework you selected
- Make the grid responsive and on mobile screens (< 768px) make sure the sidenav disappears completely.
- When you move with your mouse over the "learn more" button, show a tooltip with some extra text. You can use the bootstrap
  [tooltips](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/tooltips/) for this.
- Publish your result
